Our application ‘Stonks’ is primarily a dry trading platform where users can simulate buying and selling public companies (and cryptos?) with imagined currency. Its function is to take live data from a platform and have a GUI that shows profits, losses, in both graph and numerical form along with other stock views similar to an online brokerage.

The value this application has is for users to test out stock market ideas in a risk free environment. It will have uses for people who want to learn how to trade stocks without any risk of losing money, and for people who are looking to write bots to automate and create algorithms for trading. Our app will have an advantage in its API that can be called through code, letting users automate the process easily.



Our app does not require an especially complicated backend. We will receive our stock data from an external API, and all formatting and calculations on this data can be done clientside.
