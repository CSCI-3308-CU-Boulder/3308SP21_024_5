Our application ‘Stonks’ is a dry trading platform where users can simulate buying and selling public companies and cryptos. Its function is to take live data from an API (Finnhub.io) to create time series graphs and simulate trading. Additionally, instead of news feeds, our application shows articles from WallStreetBets, a reddit feed.   

The value this application has is for users to test out stock market ideas in a risk free environment. It will have uses for people who want to learn how to trade stocks without any risk of losing money, and for people who are looking to request trading data. In the trading world that we live in today, we see the value of the online community's oppinion on the stock market. After The GME craze, many stocks are valued based on what online threads say about them. And orgaized plays are orchistrated on groups such as reddit.

Our app does not require an especially complicated backend. We will receive our stock data from an external API, and all formatting and calculations on this data can be done clientside.
