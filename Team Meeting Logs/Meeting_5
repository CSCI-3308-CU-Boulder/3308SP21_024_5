Things to work on for next week

Connect website to the database

Rather than spending a ton of time making the website looking pretty we shhould figure out more features within graphs and pages.

We want to limit how many clientside opertions we are running, so Middleman API? Dedoss attack? 

Finnhub.io is better than polygon.io for our purposes because we nee live data as opposed to end of day data.
