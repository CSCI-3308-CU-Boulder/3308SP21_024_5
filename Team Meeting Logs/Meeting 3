Meeting 3: 25 Minutes

Wire Frames

Done with node in week 9 (March 8th) - we should know everything to build website

Up until then, its difficult to make tasks and things - we can start by builing layers such as login page in HTML, when we do node we can do slices.

Once we can start building features, start right away because HTML and wireframes wont cut it.

Gira Layout:
  * In backlog, have amount of sprints and do issues within each sprint.
  * Ex. Homepage - imagine it is our first sprint, but the node part wont come until later.
  * There needs to be a sequence of sprints that lead us to prioject completion.
  * We can edit the sprints an user stories, but the project plan must represent the timeline to be done on time. (These timelines are tenetive...)
  * Epics are going to split up representing our sprints. The sprints will have everything.
  * 
  
 In the readme, there must be a description of where everything is, how to run the code.. etc.
 
 
 From lab 1, Archtecture should be done in lucidchart - we need to keep updating them and keep using them for lab 6. 
 It should have actual archatecture like an external server, where we get stocks from, etc. 
 There is a table on canvas where we can find examples of archatecture diagram. Project tools and resources under week 2
 
 
 Reddit, Firebase and some stock API are things we wont cover in class, so we should note them and post the learning process on git.
 
 Under Resources in the README (I spent time learning firebase), post some links in there.
